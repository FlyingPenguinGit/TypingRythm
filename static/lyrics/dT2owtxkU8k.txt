[Verse 1]
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin', mmm
And maybe I should stop and start confessin', confessin', yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shakin'
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
[Post-Chorus]
There's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
[Verse 2]
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation[Pre-Chorus]
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessin', woah
And maybe I should stop and start confessin', confessin', yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shakin'
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
[Post-Chorus]
There's nothin' holdin' me back
[Bridge]
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right
If you were by my side, we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be all right, we would be all right[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shakin'
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
[Outro]
(Oh, woah)
There's nothin' holdin' me back
I feel so free when you're with me, baby
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
