[Verse 1]
Look at me now
Said I wouldn't do it, but I hunted you down
Know you had a girl but it didn't work out
Know you bought a house but you had to move out, and
I'm not proud
Guess I'm just scared of you shootin' it down
You can just talk, and I'll stare at your mouth
You could be bad, but I wanna find out, and
[Pre-Chorus]
And I wake up
In the middle of the night
With the light on
And I feel like I could die
'Cause you're not here
And it don't feel right
'Cause you're not here
[Chorus]
God, I'm actually invested
Haven't even met him
Watch this be the wrong thing, classic
God, I'm jumpin' in the deep end
It's more fun to swim in
Heard the risk is drownin', but I'm gonna take it[Post-Chorus]
I'm gonna take it, oh, woah
[Verse 2]
Isn't it fun
Thinkin' I'm right when I'm probably wrong?
Holdin' my breath like I met someone
Knowin' damn well that I haven't been touched by you
In my head
You're in the car, and you're comin' to me
And you get to my door, and you can't even speak
But I think that it's sweet, yeah, I think that you're sweet
[Pre-Chorus]
And I wake up (I wake up)
In the middle of the night (Night)
With the light on
And you're not here
[Chorus]
God, I'm actually invested
Haven't even met him
Watch this be the wrong thing, classic
God, I'm jumpin' in the deep end
It's more fun to swim in
Heard the risk is drownin', but I'm gonna take it[Bridge]
I'm gonna bend 'til I break and
You'll be my favorite mistake
I wish you could hold me here shakin'
You're the risk, I'm gonna take it
Why aren't you here in my bedroom?
Hopelessly boring without you
Too soon to tell you I love you
Too soon to tell you I love you
[Chorus]
God, I'm actually invested
Think I really want this
I'm not even kidding
No, I'm actually invested
Haven't even met yet
Wish that I was kidding, I'm not, and I hate it
God, I'm actually invested
Haven't even met yet
Watch this be the wrong thing, classic
God, I'm jumpin' in the deep end
It's more fun to swim in
Heard the risk is drownin', but I'm gonna take it
[Outro]
(Oh) I'm gonna take it
Heard the risk is drownin', but I'm gonna take it
Too soon to tell you I love you
Too soon to tell you I love you
Too soon to tell you I love you
You're the risk, I'm gonna take it
