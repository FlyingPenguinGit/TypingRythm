[Refrain: Rihanna]
I've been everywhere, man, looking for someone
Someone who can please me, love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man, looking for you, babe
Looking for you, babe, searching for you, babe

Where have you been?
'Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah?
Somewhere in the crowd
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All my life, life, life, life
Where have you been all my li-i-i-i-i-ife?
Where have you been all my li-i-i-i-i-ife?
Where have you been all my li-i-i-i-i-ife?
Where have you been all my life?
