[Verse One: S.M.O.S]
Feel no soul, vision blurred, some days I'm just lost for words
All the things that I've observed, all the pain I have endured
Gotten lost at every turn, down the road my car had swerved
Life be coming fast but sometimes you gotta hit the curve
Stuck with me for many years, held my hand and wiped my tears
You were there to fight my fears, coach me on and give me cheers
Call you up and you'd appear, guided me through my career, Now I only see you through the...
[Hook: Bruno Mars (Pre-Recorded) ]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again
[Verse Two: S.M.O.S]
Some days I can barely breathe, losing sleep I'm counting sheep
You were gone like every week, now we barely even speak
Can't believe you had to cheat, everything thrown at your feet
Don't you even think of me, cause she's the one you're supposed to please
Spent your time with her instead, after work with her again
Left her kids both unattend, been too busy giving head
At the bars been blowing bread, endless nights that never end
Opened wounds that never mend, one more cut and I'd be dead[Hook: Bruno Mars (Pre-Recorded) ]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again
[Verse Three: S.M.O.S]
Wishing that the mirror breaks, won't hesitate to seal ya fate
All the lies that you create, and all that love has turned to hate
All you did was fuck around, through the night drive into town
Come home late turn back around, no wonder why we're distant now
As I watched my mama cry, with your fucking pair of eyes
Both our feelings intertwined, hearts became so paralyzed
All the pain she felt inside, grew grew with every lie
This is what you had in mind, leaving us unsatisfied
[Hook: Bruno Mars (Pre-Recorded) ]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other againSampled Beat: Mirror - Lil Wayne Ft. Bruno Mars
