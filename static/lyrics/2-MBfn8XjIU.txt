[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor]
I found myself dreamin'
In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
We were walkin' on moonlight
And you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone
[Pre-Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief,
and I've realised
No, we're not promised tomorrow
[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standin' (Mm)
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
[Post-Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you, ooh)
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you[Verse 2: John Legend,Meghan Trainor,Both]
In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The
truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, babe (Hey; ah)
Any chance that I get (Ah)
I'll make the
most of the minutes
And love with no regret
[Pre-Chorus: John Legend,Meghan Trainor,Both]
Let's take our time to say what we want (Say what we want)
Use what we got before it's all gone (All gone)
'Cause no (No),
we're not promised tomorrow
[Chorus: Meghan Trainor & John Legend,Meghan Trainor]
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you)
I'm gonna hold you (Hey)
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standin' (Yeah)
I won't take you for granted (No, no)
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
[Post-Chorus: Meghan Trainor,John Legend,Both]
So I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you; oh)
Like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you; lose you, baby no)
I'm gonna love you (Love you)
Like I'm gonna
lose you
(Hey)[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus: Meghan Trainor,Meghan Trainor & John Legend,John Legend]
I'm gonna love you (Oh)
Like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna
hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye (Bye)
Wherever we're standin'
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
[Post-Chorus: Meghan Trainor,John Legend,Both]
So I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you, baby)
Like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna love you (Oh; gonna love you)
Like I'm gonna
lose you
