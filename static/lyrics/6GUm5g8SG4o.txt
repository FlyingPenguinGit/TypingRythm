[Chorus: Adam Levine]
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly
Would you still love me the same? (Need 'em)
If I showed you my flaws (Whirl)
If I couldn't be strong (Why)
Tell me honestly
Would you still love me the same?
[Verse 1: Theron Thomas]
Right about now (What)
If a judge 'for life' me, would ya stay by my side? (Ya)
Or is you gonna say goodbye? (Bye, bye, bye)
Can you tell me right now? (Can you tell me)
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life (My, my)
Shawty, would it be alright? (Right)
Come on, show me that you are down (Down, down, down, down)
