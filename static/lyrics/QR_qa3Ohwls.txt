We're turning up the love (W-w-we're in Kenan Thompson's crib now put yo' hands up, K' now-)

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind (I-I-I)
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love[Verse: Ke$ha]
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave (You leave)
Hey, so I got a question (You leave)
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement? (You leave)
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug? (When you leave)
Your drug (You leave)
Huh, your drug (You leave)
Huh, your drug (When you leave)
Is my love your drug?

[Intro: Austin Mahone]
I, I'm feeling your thunder
The storm's getting closer
This rain is like fire
And my, my world's going under
And I can't remember
The reason that you cut off the line
[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
You're moving on, you say?
Here I stay
I'll take this pain, yeah, I can, I can
[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
But what about love?
What about our promises?
What about love?
You take it all and leave me nothing
What about love?
What about us 'til the end?
What about love?
You cut my wings, now I am falling
What about love?
What about love?
[Verse 2: Austin Mahone]
Why you colder than winter?
You're switching the picture
You used to be perfect, yeah
Once, you're hot like the summer
Please help me remember
The reason that you said, “Bye bye bye”
[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
You're moving on, you say?
Here I stay
I'll take this pain, yeah, I can, I can
[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
But what about love?
What about our promises?
What about love?
You take it all and leave me nothing
What about love?
What about us 'til the end?
What about love?
You cut my wings, now I am falling
What about love?
What about love?

Part 9: Miranda Cosgrove - Disgusting
[Verse 1: Miranda Cosgrove]
My heart booms at the speed of light
But the exit sign's always on my mind, always in my sight
I could say that I really want to stay
But the devil inside always wins the fight, always gets his way
[Pre-Chorus: Miranda Cosgrove &Shaun Dixon]
Jump out the window, gotta get out on the highway
When things are getting too attached, I need an escape
I'm seein' stars and there is nothing more that I hate, baby
There's something that I gotta say (No!)
[Chorus: Miranda Cosgrove]
It's disgusting, how I love you
I can't take it, I should hate you
'Cause you're messin' up my name
Gotta walk my talk, my fame
But I just wanna touch your face
It's disgusting
It's disgusting how you changed me
From a bandit to a baby
Think I might gotta change my name
If I'm gonna walk this walk of shame
Look at what you do to me
It's disgusting
