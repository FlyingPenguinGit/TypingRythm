[Verse 1]
Mummy, they call me names, they wouldn't let me play
I'd run home, sit and cry almost everyday
"Hey Jessica, you look like an alien
With green skin, you don't fit in this playpen!"
Oh, they pull my hair, they took away my chair
I'd keep it in and pretend that I didn't care
"Hey Jessica, you're so funny!
You've got teeth just like Bugs Bunny!"
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, so you think you know me now
Have you forgotten how
You would make me feel
When you dragged my spirit down?
But thank you for the pain
It made me raise my game
And I'm still rising, I'm still rising
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
So make your jokes, go for broke
Blow your smoke, you're not alone
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?
So raise the bar, hit me hard
Play your cards, be a star
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm in LA, you think I've made my fame
FB makes us friends when you only really know my name
"Oh Jessie, we knew you could make it!
I've got a track and I'd love you to take it!"
So now because I'm signed, you think my pockets lined
Four years now, and I'm still waiting in the line
"Oh Jessie, I saw you on YouTube!
I tagged old photos from when we was at school!"
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, so you think you know me now
Have you forgotten how
You would make me feel
When you dragged my spirit down?
But thank you for the pain
It made me raise my game
And I'm still rising, I'm still rising
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
So make your jokes, go for broke
Blow your smoke, you're not alone
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?
So raise the bar, hit me hard
Play your cards, be a star
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?[Verse 3]
(Jessie) She broke outta the box
Swallowed your pride, you got that ego cough
Let the haters hate
You're like, way too late
(Click, click)
See, I got a message from you
"Hola! I'm proud of you!"
"Oh my god, babe, your voice is like, wow!"
My reply,
"Who's laughing now?"
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, so you think you know me now
Have you forgotten how
You would make me feel
When you dragged my spirit down?
But thank you for the pain
It made me raise my game
And I'm still rising, I'm still rising
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
So make your jokes, go for broke
Blow your smoke, you're not alone
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?
So raise the bar, hit me hard
Play your cards, be a star
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?
So make your jokes, go for broke
Blow your smoke, you're not alone
But who's laughing now? (Hey, hey, who's laughing?)
But who's laughing now? (Hey, hey, who's laughing?)
So raise the bar, hit me hard
Play your cards, be a star
But who's laughing now? (Who's laughing louder now?)
[Stuttering][Outro]
But who's laughing, laughing now?
But who's laughing, laughing now?
But who's laughing, laughing now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But who's laughing, laughing now?
But who's laughing, laughing now?
But who's laughing, laughing now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
