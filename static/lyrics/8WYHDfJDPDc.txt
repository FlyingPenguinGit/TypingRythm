I love you
And I need you

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland &Nelly]
No matter what I do (Woo)

[Verse 1: Nelly &Kelly Rowland]
I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me (And, uh)
She got the hots for me, the finest thing my hood done seen
But oh no, no
She got a man and a son though, oh (Check it)
But that's okay 'cause I
Wait for my cue and just listen, play my position
Like a shortstop, pick up everything mami hittin'
And in no time (No time)
I plan to make this one here mine
And that's for sure 'cause I
I never been the type to (Never) break up a happy home (But, uh)
There's somethin' 'bout baby girl, I just can't leave alone
So tell me, ma, what's it gonna be?
She said,
"You don't know what you mean to me"
(Come on)[Chorus: Kelly Rowland &Nelly]
No matter what I do (Woo)
All I think about is you (Uh-huh)
Even when I'm with my boo (Ooh)
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you
No matter what I do (Check it)
All I think about is you (Check it, check it, check it)
Even when I'm with my boo (Check it, check it, check it)
You know I'm crazy over you (Check it, check it, check it) (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
[Verse 2: Nelly &Kelly Rowland]
I see y'all out and you lookin', I never say a word
I know how niggas start actin', trippin', I heard about they girls (Uh)
And there's no way
Nelly gon' fight over no dame (I ain't gon' fight over no dame)
As you can see (But I)
I like your steeze, your style, your whole demeanor
The way you come through and holla and swoop me in his two-seater
Now that's gangster
And I got special ways to thank ya
Don't you forget it (But, uh)
It ain't that easy for you to pack up and leave him (But, uh)
You and Derrty got ties for different reasons
I respect that, and right before I turn to leave
She said,
"You don't know what you mean to me"
(She said, she said, she said, come on)[Chorus: Kelly Rowland &Nelly]
No matter what I do (Woo)
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo (Yeah)
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you (Uh, uh, put your hands up)
No matter what I do (Put your hands up)
All I think about is you (Uh, yeah, yeah)
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you (Sing it for me, K)
[Bridge: Kelly Rowland,Nelly,Both]
And I love you (Word?)
And I need you (Yeah, uh)
