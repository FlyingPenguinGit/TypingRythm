[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Wasted (Wasted)
And the more I drink, the more I think about you
Oh, no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now? Are you happy now?[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, hear it from that one
That you got someone new
Yeah, I see, but don't believe it
Even in my head, you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be? (What we used to be)
Is it better now that I'm not around? (That I'm not around)
My friends are actin' strange (Yeah), they don't bring up your name (Hmm)
Are you happy now? (Hmm) Are you happy now?
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
No more “please stop” (Oh, hey)
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots (Oh, oh, hey)
No more tryna make me jealous on your birthday (Oh, oh, oh, hey)
You know just how I make it better on your birthday, oh (Uh, oh, uh, oh)
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this? (Oh, hey)
Do he lay it down for you, touch you, pull you like this? (Oh, oh, hey)
Matter of fact, never mind, we gon' let the past be (Oh, oh, oh, hey)
Maybe he's right now, but your body's still with me, whoa (Uh, oh, uh, oh)
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
