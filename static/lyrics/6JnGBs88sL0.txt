[Intro: Timbaland]
Frk-frk-down
Hey
You don't mean nothin' at all to me
Hey, hey
[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado]
In the day, in the night
Say it right, say it all
You either got it, or you don't
You either stand, or you fall
When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for jokin'
There's a hole in the plan
[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
Oh, you don't mean nothin' at all to me
No, you don't mean nothin' at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh, you could mean everything to me
[Verse 2: Nelly Furtado]
I can't say (Say) that I'm not (Not)
Lost (Lost) and at fault (Fault)
I can't say (Say) that I don't (Don't)
Love the light (Light) and the dark
I can't say that I don't (Don't)
Know that I (I) am alive (Oh)
And all of what I feel (Feel)
I could show (Show you) you tonight, you tonight[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
Oh, you don't mean nothin' at all to me
No, you don't mean nothin' at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh, you could mean everything to me
[Verse 3: Nelly Furtado]
From my hands, I could give you
Somethin' that I made
From my mouth, I could sing you
Another brick that I laid
From my body (From my body), I could show you (I could show you)
A place (A place) God knows (That only God knows)
You should know space is holy (Ah)
Do you really wanna go? (Three, four)
[Outro: Timbaland]
Hey, hey, hey
You don't mean nothin' at all to me
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
You don't mean nothin' at all to me
Hey, hey
