[Intro]
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
(Hahahahaha)
[Verse 1]
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on
It ain't my fault you got, got me so gone
It ain't my fault I'm not leavin' alone
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on
[Refrain]
I can't talk right now, I'm lookin' and I like what I'm seein'
Got me feelin' kinda shocked right now
Couldn't stop right now, even if I wanted, gotta get it, get it
Get it when it's hot right now
Oh my God, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist, please don't blame me
For whatever happens next
[Pre-Chorus]
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
If I-I-I-I get you in trouble now
See, you're too irresistible
Yeah, that's for sure
So,
if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
Responsible[Chorus]
It ain't my fault
Nope, nope, nope, nope
Nope, nope, nope
It ain't my fault
Nope, nope, nope, nope
Nope, nope, nope
It ain't my fault
[Verse 2]
It ain't my fault you came here lookin' like that
You just made me trip, fall and land on your lap
Certain bad boy smooth, body hotter than a summer
I don't mean to be rude, but I'd look so damn good on ya
[Refrain]
Ain't got time right now,
missed me with that
"What's your name, your sign" right now
It's light outside,
I just called an Uber
And it's right outside
Oh my God, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist, please don't blame me
For whatever happens next
[Pre-Chorus]
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
If I-I-I-I get you in trouble now
See, you're too irresistible
Yeah, that's for sure
So, if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
Responsible[Chorus]
It ain't my fault
Nope, nope, nope, nope
Nope, nope, nope
It ain't my fault
Nope, nope, nope, nope
Nope, nope, nope
It ain't my fault
[Bridge]
Baby, one, two, three
Your body's callin' me
And I know wherever you're at is exactly
Where I wanna be, but don't blame me
[Interlude]
It ain't my fault
(Nope, nope, nope, nope)
It ain't my fault (Oh)
(Nope, nope, nope, nope)
It ain't my fault (Oh)
(Nope, nope, nope, nope) (Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
It ain't my fault (Ooh-ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see (Ayy, yeah)
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me (Oh yeah)
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
Responsible[Chorus]
It ain't my fault
Nope, nope, nope (No, woah), nope
Nope, nope (It ain't my fault), nope
It ain't my fault
Nope (No), nope, nope (No), nope (No, woah)
Nope, nope, nope
It ain't my fault
[Outro]
It ain't my fault you got me so gone (Nope, nope, nope, nope)
It ain't my fault
It ain't my fault you got me so gone (Nope, nope, nope, nope)
It ain't my fault
(Nope, nope, nope, nope) Oh, woah

Well, that's too bad (Nope, nope, nope, nope)
It ain't my fault
