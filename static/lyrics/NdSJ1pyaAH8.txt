[Chorus: Halsey]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover I'd never lie
He said, "Be true," I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I, him and I
[Verse 1: G-Eazy,G-Eazy & Halsey]
My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Uh, got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my **** (Hahaha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince, you know?[Chorus: Halsey &G-Eazy]
Cross my heart, hope to die (Uh)
To my lover I'd never lie (I love you, baby)
He said, "Be true," I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I
[Post-Chorus: Halsey &G-Eazy]
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah (Uh)
In the end, it's him and I (Yeah)
[Verse 2: G-Eazy,G-Eazy & Halsey]
It's her and I mobbin' 'til the end of time
Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
'Member this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie, my funeral will be lit if I
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my
down bitch
, see, that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs
together
, fuck up clubs
together
And we'd both go
crazy
if we was to sever, you know?
We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?[Chorus: Halsey &G-Eazy]
Cross my heart (Uh), hope to die
To my lover I'd never lie
He said, "Be true," I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I
[Post-Chorus: Halsey]
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end, it's him and I
[Bridge: Halsey &G-Eazy]
Cross my heart, hope to die
, to you I've never lied
For you I'd take a life
, it's him and I, and I swear, ayy
'Til the end I'ma ride wit' you
Mob and get money, get high wit' you
(Ayy),
yeah
Cross my heart, hope to die
, this is our ride-or-die
You can confide in me, there's not no hiding, I swear
Stay solid, never lie to you
Swear most likely I'ma die wit' you, yeah[Chorus: Halsey]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover I'd never lie
He said, "Be true," I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I
[Post-Chorus: Halsey]
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
