[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, woah
I been drinkin' too much for sure
I got a hangover, woah
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever, ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it goin', k-keep, keep it goin'
[Drop: Taio Cruz]
Yeah (Oh)
(Oh)
[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
I got a little bit trashed last night, night
I got a little bit wasted (Yeah, yeah)
I got a little bit mashed last night, night
I got a little shit-faceted (Yeah, yeah)
[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Well (Oh)
I'm gonna roll
If you don't know
Well, now you know[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, woah
I been drinkin' too much for sure
I got a hangover, woah
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever, ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it goin', k-keep, keep it goin', come on
[Drop: Taio Cruz]
Yeah (Oh)
(Oh)
[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Drink up, 'cause a party ain't a party 'til you ride on through it
End up on the floor, you can't remember, you clueless
Officer like, "What the hell is you doin'?"
Stumblin', fumblin', you wanna what? Come again?
Gimme Henn, gimme gin, gimme liquor
Gimme champagne bubbles 'til I'm bent
What happens after that? If you inspired, tell a friend
Like, "Oh, my homie, Taio, we can all sip again," get it in
And again and again, leave evidence
Wasted, so what? Irrelevant
Beer keg to the head, who's sellin' it?
I got a hangover, that's my medicine
Don't mean to brag or sound too intelligent
A little Jack can't hurt this veteran
I show up, but I never throw up
So let the drinks go up, pour up[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, woah
I been drinkin' too much for sure
I got a hangover, woah
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever, ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it goin', k-keep, keep it goin', come on
Come on
Come on
[Drop: Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, woah
I been drinkin' too much for sure
I got a hangover, woah
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever, ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it goin', k-keep, keep it goin', come on
