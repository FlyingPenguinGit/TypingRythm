[Intro]
Ayy
Ayy, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh
[Verse]
The way we move, uh, skin onto skin
No separation, need no conversation, nah, nah, nah
Uh, on everything
It's automatic, goin' zero to a hun-na-na
Ride, and wishin' the wheels would fall off
Time is tickin', it's takin' you too long
Right before I decide to go home
[Chorus]
Act like you heard me
Only serve it up if you deserve me, yeah
Pull up and earn me (Pusha, pusha)
Push to start (Pusha, pusha)
Act like you heard me
Only serve it up if you deserve me, yeah
Pull up and earn me (Pusha, pusha)
Push to start (Pusha, pusha)
[Post-Chorus]
Mm, pushin' on my buttons with no hesitation ('Tation)
Gas me up, give me motivation ('Vation)
So tell me where we goin', pick a destination ('Nation)
Gas me up, give me motivation now ('Vation)
Pushin' on my buttons with no hesitation ('Tation)
Gas me up, give me motivation ('Vation)
So tell me where we goin', pick a destination ('Nation)
Gas me up, give me motivation now (Nah)[Bridge]
Come give me life, and I'll change yours
Who needs signs? I say, "Floor it"
On a high when we load it
Hold me, load me, hold me
[Chorus]
Act like you heard me
Only serve it up if you deserve me, yeah
Pull up and earn me (Pusha, pusha)
Push to start (Pusha, pusha)
Act like you heard me
Only serve it up if you deserve me, yeah
Pull up and earn me (Pusha, pusha)
Push to start (Pusha, pusha)
[Post-Chorus]
Mm, pushin' on my buttons with no hesitation ('Tation)
Gas me up, give me motivation ('Vation)
So tell me where we goin', pick a destination ('Nation)
Gas me up, give me motivation now ('Vation)
Pushin' on my buttons with no hesitation ('Tation)
Gas me up, give me motivation ('Vation)
So tell me where we goin', pick a destination ('Nation)
Gas me up, give me motivation now (Nah)[Outro]
Give me life, I'll change yours
Who needs signs? I say, "Floor it"
On a high when we load it
Oh
