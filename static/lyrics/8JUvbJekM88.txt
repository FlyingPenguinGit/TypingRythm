[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With awkward situations, empty conversations
[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get
[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
So, this is where the story ends
A conversation on I.M
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With texting, sorry for the miscommunication
[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Next time I see you
I'm giving you a high five
'Cause hugs are overrated, just FYI
[Breakdown: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two, yeah
[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get
[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Call I'll never get
Call I'll never get
