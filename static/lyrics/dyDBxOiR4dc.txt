[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
(It's gonna be me)
Ooh, yeah
[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake,Justin Timberlake & Chris Kirkpatrick]
You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go (Oh, oh)
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in “no man, no cry”
Maybe that's why
[Chorus: All]
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what? It's gonna be me
[Verse 2: J.C. Chasez,JC Chasez & Chris Kirkpatrick,J.C. Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick & Justin Timberlake]
You've got no choice, babe
But to move on and you know
There ain't no time to waste
You're just
too blind (Too blind) to see
But in the end, you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me
why[Chorus: All,Justin Timberlake&J.C. Chasez]
Every little thing I do (Do)
Never seems enough for you (You)
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally (Finally)
Get to love somebody (Somebody)
Guess what? (Guess what?) It's gonna be me
(It’s gonna be me)
[Middle 8]
(It's gonna be me)
Ooh, yeah, yeah
There comes a day when I'll be the one
You'll see
(It's gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna)
It's gonna be me
[Bridge: All,Justin Timberlake&J.C. Chasez]
All that I do is not enough for you
I don't wanna lose it, but I'm not like that
When finally (Finally), you get to love (Ah)
Guess what? (Guess what? It’s gonna be me)
[Chorus: All,Justin Timberlake&J.C. Chasez]
Every little thing I do (I do)
Never seems enough for you (For you, babe)

You don't wanna lose it again (Don't wanna lose it)
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally (Finally)
Get to love somebody (Love somebody)
Guess what? (Guess what?)
It's gonna be me
