[Chorus: George Harrison,George Harrison & Paul McCartney]
Here comes the sun, doo-d-doo-doo
Here comes the sun
And I say,
"It's alright"
[Verse 1: George Harrison,George Harrison & Paul McCartney]
Little darling
It's been a long, cold, lonely winter
Little darling
It feels like years since it's been here
[Chorus: George Harrison & Paul McCartney,George Harrison]
Here comes the sun, doo-d-doo-doo
Here comes the sun
And I say,
"It's alright"
[Verse 2: George Harrison,George Harrison & Paul McCartney]
Little darling
The smile's returning to the faces
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been here
[Chorus: George Harrison & Paul McCartney,George Harrison]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say,
"It's alright"[Bridge: George Harrison & Paul McCartney]
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
[Verse 3: George Harrison,George Harrison & Paul McCartney]
Little darling
I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been clear
[Chorus: George Harrison & Paul McCartney,George Harrison]
But
here comes the sun, doo-d-doo-doo
Here comes the sun
And I say,
"It's alright"
Here comes the sun, doo-d-doo-doo
Here comes the sun
It's alright
It's alright
