[Verse 1]
Know I've done wrong
Left your heart torn
Is that what devils do?
Took you so low
Where only fools go
I shook the angel in you
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do
[Chorus]
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
[Post-Chorus]
Can you love me again?[Verse 2]
It's unforgivable
I stole and burnt your soul
Is that what demons do? (Yeah)
They rule the worst of me
Destroy everything
They bring down angels like you (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do
[Chorus]
(Alright)
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
(Alright, oh-oh-oh)
(Can you love me again?)
(Alright)
Can you love me again?
[Instrumental Breakdown][Bridge]
Oh, I told you once, I can't do this again
Do this again, oh lord
I told you once, I can't do this again
Do this again, oh no
[Chorus]
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now, oh-oh
(Can you love me again?)
(Can you love me again?)
Can you love me again? (Oh, no)
Can you love me again?
