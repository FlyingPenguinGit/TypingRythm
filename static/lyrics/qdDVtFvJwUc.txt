[Intro]
Oh-woo
Oh-woo (It's JB)
[Verse 1]
My friends say I'm a fool to think that you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
'Cause honestly, the truth is that you know I'm never leaving
'Cause you're my angel sent from above
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you can do no wrong, my money is yours (Oh)
Give you little more because I love ya (Oh), love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise, my dear, I'll put nothin' above ya, above ya (Oh)
[Chorus]
Love me, love me (Hey), say that you love me
Fool me, fool me (Hey), oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me (Hey), say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear (Oh-oh-oh-oh), tell me you love me
Love me, love me (Hey), say that you love me (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Fool me, fool me (Hey), oh, how you do me (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Kiss me, kiss me (Hey), say that you miss me (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tell me what I want to hear (Oh-oh-oh-oh), tell me you love me[Verse 2]
People try to tell me, but I still refuse to listen
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than a thousand days
Without your love, oh, your love, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong (Belong), just stay right here
I promise, my dear, I'll put nothin' above ya, above ya (Oh)
[Chorus]
Love me, love me (Hey), say that you love me
Fool me, fool me (Hey), oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me (Hey), say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear (Oh; Oh-oh-oh-oh), tell me you love me
Love me, love me (Hey), say that you love me (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Fool me, fool me (Hey), oh, how you do me (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Kiss me, kiss me (Hey), say that you miss me (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tell me what I want to hear (Oh-oh-oh-oh), tell me you love me
[Bridge]
My heart is blind (Oh), but I don't care (Oh)
'Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared (Oh)
And every time (Oh) I hold ya near (Oh)
I never want to let ya go, oh[Chorus]
Love me, love me (Oh; Hey), say that you love me
Fool me, fool me (Hey), oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me (Hey), say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear (Oh-oh; Oh-oh-oh-oh), tell me you love me
Love me, love me (Hey), say that you love me (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Fool me, fool me (Hey), oh, how you do me (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Kiss me, kiss me (Hey), say that you miss me (Oh; Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tell me what I want to hear (Oh-oh-oh-oh), tell me you love me
