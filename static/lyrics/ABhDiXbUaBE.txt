[Verse 1]
Electric lights
Blow my mind
I feel alright
[Refrain]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die
[Verse 2]
You catch my eye
Bitch, you wanna fly?
I'm so alive
[Refrain]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die
[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Puttin' on our dancin' shoes
Goin' to the discotheque
Gettin' high and gettin' wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Puttin' on our dancin' shoes
Goin' to the discotheque
Gettin' high and gettin' wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules[Verse 3]
I'm such a star
Queen Boulevard
Blaze through the dark
[Refrain]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die
[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Puttin' on our dancin' shoes
Goin' to the discotheque
Gettin' high and gettin' wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
[Bridge]
Get my guitar
Sunglasses on
So light it up
[Refrain]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Puttin' on our dancin' shoes
Goin' to the discotheque
Gettin' high and gettin' wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
