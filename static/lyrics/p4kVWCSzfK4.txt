[Chorus: Flo Rida]
So many girls in here, where do I begin? (Oh)
I seen this one, I'm 'bout to go in (Oh)
Then she said, "I'm here with my friends" (Oh)
She got me thinkin', and that's when I said
"Where them girls at, girls at?" (Ooh)
"Where them girls at, girls at?" (Ooh)
"Where them girls at, girls at?" (Ooh)
So go get them, we can all be friends (Ooh)
[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hey, bring it on, baby, all your friends, you're the shit and I love that body (Body)
You wanna ball explicit, I swear you're good, I won't tell nobody ('Body)
You got a BFF, I wanna see that girl, it's all women invited ('Vited)
Hairdos and nails, that Louis, Chanel all up in the party (Need some help)
Presidents in my wallet (Freak yourself)
No rules, I'm 'bout it (Pay the rounds)
Blow the whistle for the hotties (Catch my breath)
I got it, shawty, it's never too much, can't be doing too much
Ten to one of me, I can handle that love
Bottles in my reach, we can all get buzzed
Holla 'cause I'm free 'til whenever, it's no rush
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj,Nicki Minaj & Flo Rida,Flo Rida]
So many boys in here, where do I begin? (Oh)
I see this one, I'm 'bout to go in (Oh)
Then he said, "I'm here with my friends" (Ah)
He got to thinkin', and that's when he said
"Where them girls at, girls at?"
(Ooh)
"Where them girls at, girls at?"
(Ooh)
"Where them girls at, girls at?"

So go get them, we can all be friends

Peebee, Peebee, who's Peabo Bryson?
Two years ago, I renewed my license
Anyway, why'd I start my verse like that?
You can suck a dick, or you can suck on a ballsack
No, no, I don't endorse that
Pause that, abort that
Just the other day mi go a London, saw dat
Kids inna di street, paparazzi, all that
Hey, hey, what can I say?
Day, d-d-day, d-day, d-day, day
Comin' through the club, all the girls in the back of me
This ain't football, why the fuck they tryna tackle me?
Really, I peeped dude at the bar like really
Lookin' like he want a good time like really
Said he had got a friend for my home girl Lily, Lily, Lily, Lily
[Chorus: Flo Rida,Flo Rida & Nicki Minaj]
So many girls in here, where do I begin? (Oh)
