[Verse 1]
Can't be sleeping, keep on waking
Without the woman next to me
Guilt is burning, inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep
[Pre-Chorus]
So blame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
[Chorus]
Blame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
[Drop]
[Verse 2]
Can't you see it? I was manipulated
I had to let her through the door
Oh, I had no choice in this, I was the friend she missed
She needed me to talk[Pre-Chorus]
So blame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
[Chorus]
Blame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
[Drop]
[Bridge]
Oh, I'm so sorry, so sorry, baby (Oh, I promise)
(I'll be better this time, I will be better this time, I will) Yeah
Oh, I got to say (Oh, I promise)
(I'll be better this time, I will be better this time, I will), I'm so sorry
Oh, I promise (I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
[Chorus]
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me-e-e-e-e[Drop]
