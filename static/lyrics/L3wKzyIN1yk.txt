[Intro]
I'm only human
I'm only, I'm only
I'm only human, human
[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
Thinkin' I can see through this and see what's behind
Got no way to prove it, so maybe I'm lyin'
[Chorus]
But I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put your blame on me (Oh)
[Verse 2]
Take a look in the mirror and what do you see?
Do you see it clearer or are you deceived
In what you believe? (Oh)
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm only human after all
You're only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me[Refrain]
(Oh) Some people got the real problems
(Oh) Some people out of luck
(Oh) Some people think I can solve them
(Oh) Lord heavens above (Oh)
[Chorus]
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me
[Verse 3]
Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry
For making you cry
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put the blame on me
[Refrain]
(Oh) Oh, some people got the real problems
(Oh) Some people out of luck
(Oh) Some people think I can solve them
(Oh) Lord heavens above (Oh)[Chorus]
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me (Oh)
I'm only human, I make mistakes
I'm only human, that's all it takes
To put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me
[Bridge]
(Ooh) 'Cause I'm no prophet or Messiah
(Ooh) You should go lookin' somewhere higher
[Chorus]
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me
I'm only human, I do what I can
I'm just a man, I do what I can
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me
