[Verse 1]
Yeah
Bitch, I keep that gas like Hank Hill
Pop yo' shit like pain pills
Move out my lane and stay still
Don't get rocked, I roll like eight wheels
Speaking of gas I ain't passing this
I won't pass you no gas, it ain't flatulence
And that bag that you smokin' is just like a broken down car: it ain't got no gas in it
My competition is like Miley Cyrus
I see nobody
Homie, don't try me
Tell her put a date on it like Yo Gotti
I make a mothafucker fold like origami
Oouu
Some get-back is way past due
But if I stoop, then I'm no better than you
True
So I just roll up my weed and I focus on me
'Cause it's pointless to focus on you
Like Demi Lovato singing to ghosts
Mothafuckas really be doing the most
And now they title everything so if you got a brain and like to use it
Mothafuckas like to label you as woke
Woah!
Bitch, get shit on
I don't give a fuck what you think I've been on
Gotta give it all on every record that I get on and tell my haters my dick is something they should wanna sit onI do this so effortlessly
Bitch, I was born to make music evidently
I never let you fuck me, celibacy
And in my mind, ain't nobody better than me
I'ma give your ass a taste of what intelligent means
Bitch, I'm on point like a pelican beak
These are thoughts from a mind that has never been free
I'm a giant in the cave that has never been seen
Ugh
[Chorus]
I'm a self-made '90s baby, grew up with them stamps
Got a vision for my people, ain't no way I'm changing plans
I move silent, shhh, quiet
You won't see my other hand
It's like Comcast with this shit
Bitch, you can get it on demand
Oouu
[Verse 2]
Bitch, I gotta vendetta like Def Jam
She want the dick, I'm like, "Yes Ma'am"
But as far as we go
Bitch, you know that I am not a mutant
I can't be your ex-man
I take a bite up out the apple like a MacBook logo
Bounce that ass on my dick like pogo sticks
Pussy get ate, ocho, bitch
Don't be late to this appointmentI be higher than a mothafuckin' UFO
Get butt-naked, bitch, that's the new dress code
I'm a cryogenic lab if you just froze
Got a blueprint ready if the shit unfolds
Homie, you are not hot
Hit you in the snot box
We can get it poppin', get it poppin' like some Pop Rocks
Chopper going chop-chop
Turn you to a crop top
I'ma keep climbing, yeah, climbing to the top spot
Ooouu
I been a problem, been a problem aye
Benefactor that's been a factor
You say you wanna volley something but we can turn this into tennis practice
Been the sickest after Mr. Mathers
Grab your neck and twist it backwards
It's fantastic, get ripped in half
I raise the roof and lift the rafters
Then go and listen to Limp Bizkit after
I'll go tit for tat with any rapper
When it comes to these bars, I'm writing chapters
About my family, that's another matter
For them, I will swing like batter batter
I'll be on your roof making such a clatter
While you underneath it tryna pitter-patter
My feet in your ceiling
You see where I'm going?
To get up here, you need a bigger ladder
I'm Kydd, bitch![Chorus]
I'm a self-made '90s baby, grew up with them stamps
Got a vision for my people, ain't no way I'm changing plans
I move silent, shhh, quiet
You won't see my other hand
It's like Comcast with this shit
Bitch, you can get it on demand
Oouu
