[Verse 1]
Ain't this what you came to see?
Let me be your muse, I'll inspire you
In ways you won't believe (Oh, woah)
Fifty shades and hues, tailor-made for you
[Pre-Chorus]
Drew me in, look at what you started
Go with your hands, can you paint my body? (Body)
Go 'head and brush up on me
Baby, when you own it, sign it, dot it (Oh, woah)
[Chorus]
I'll be your piece
I'll be your peace
I'll be your piece
Your A-R-T
Study my face (Face), frame (Frame)
Put me on the wall
Above the stair (Stair) case (Case)
If you show me off
I'll be your piece
Your A-R-T
[Verse 2]
Fresh out the gallery
Can you handle me? Handle me carefully
I'll be yours to keep (I'll be yours)
I'm your centrepiece, make the canvas speak[Pre-Chorus]
When you drew me in, look at what you started
Go with your hands, can you paint my body? (Paint my body)
Go 'head and brush up on me
Baby, when you own it, sign it, dot it (Ooh)
[Chorus]
I'll be your piece (I'll be your)
I'll be your peace
I'll be your piece
Your A-R-T
Study my face (Face), frame (Frame)
Put me on the wall
Above the stair (Stair) case (Case)
If you show me off
I'll be your piece
Your A-R-T
[Outro]
I'll be your piece
Your A-R-T
