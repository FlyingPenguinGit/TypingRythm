[Intro]
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
[Chorus]
This that pretty-girl mantra,
this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A.​
Pretty girls don't do drama 'less we wanna, it'll be depending on the day
Pretty girls packed in a Defender, know I'ma defend her, never let her catch no stray
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways
[Verse 1]
Mix me with the drama (Drama)
Check you like commas (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
My clothes are pajamas ('Jamas)
Straight from the cold plunge (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Daytime baddie use her mind
Quick switch of the fit for the night (Night)
Swеrvin' through the lane, we'll bе twenty minute late
'Cause we had to do an In-N-Out drive-by
[Pre-Chorus]
It's not that deep (Deep), I'm not that drunk (Drunk)
Sometimes, girls just gotta have fun
Throw it back, all that ass
Me and my sis, way too attached
It's not that deep (Deep), we're not that dumb (Dumb)
Look at them Bonnies on the run
Inside glowin' like the sun (Sun, s—)
You're gonna feel this every day (Day)[Chorus]
This that pretty-girl mantra,
this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A.​
Pretty girls don't do drama 'less we wanna, it'll be depending on the day
Pretty girls packed in a Defender, know I'ma defend her, never let her catch no stray
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways
[Verse 2]
Love what it feel like (Feel like)
To be off of the grid like all night
Oh, with my bih, like (Bitch, like)
We ain't even tryna talk no one
Swerve off all the creeps, no weird vibes
We ain't never let it ruin a good time
Ain't nobody gon' dim our good light
This them words we're livin' by
[Chorus]
This that pretty-girl mantra,
this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A. (Ah)
Pretty girls don't do drama 'less we wanna, it'll be depending on the day (Ah, ah, ah)
Pretty girls packed in a Defender, know I'ma defend her, never let her catch no stray (Ah, ah)
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways (Ah, ah, ah)
This that pretty-girl mantra, this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A. (Ah, ah)
Pretty girls don't do trauma
, no new drama, we already got a full day (Ah, ah)
Pretty girls that you gon' remember, know that you could never, nothing ever trigger me (Ah, ah)
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, everyone knows she is me (Ah)[Outro]
Hahahahahahaha
