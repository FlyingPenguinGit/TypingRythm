[Intro: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keepin' me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had 'em pushin' daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit
[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
By the way, what he say? (Hey, hey)
He can tell I ain't missing no meals (Hey)
Come through and fuck him in my automobile (Hey)
Let him eat it with his grills, he keep tellin' me to chill
He keep tellin' me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
(Hey)
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab (Hey)
So I pulled up in the Jag and I hit him with the jab like (Hey)
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun (Hey, hey)
[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Look at her butt, look at, look at, look at
Look at her butt
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
This dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talkin' 'bout Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he callin' me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit
[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
By the way, what he say? (Hey, hey)
He can tell I ain't missing no meals (Hey)
Come through and fuck him in my automobile (Hey)
Let him eat it with his grills, he keep tellin' me to chill
He keep tellin' me it's real, that he love my sex appeal (Hey)
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab (Hey)
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like (Hey)
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun (Hey, hey)[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh-oh-oh, oh my gosh, look at her butt
Look at her butt, look at, look at, look at
Look at her butt
[Breakdown: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
Little in the middle, but she got much back
Little in the middle, but she got much back
Little in the middle, but she got much back
Oh my God, look at her butt
[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Don't, my anaconda don't
Don't want none unless you got buns, hun
[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj &Sir Mix-a-Lot]
