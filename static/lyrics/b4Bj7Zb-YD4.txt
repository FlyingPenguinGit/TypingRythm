[Verse]
Why wait to say? At least I did it my way
Lie awake, two-faced, but in my heart, I understand
I made my move, and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed
[Chorus]
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
[Post-Chorus]
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way
My way
My way
[Verse]
Why wait to say? At least I did it my way
Lie awake, two-faced, but in my heart, I understand
I made my move, and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed (Yeah)[Chorus]
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
[Post-Chorus]
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way
[Chorus]
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
[Post-Chorus]
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
