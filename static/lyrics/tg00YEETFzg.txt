[Verse 1]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standin' side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
[Pre-Chorus]
It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
[Chorus]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go-ooh-oh[Chorus]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
[Bridge]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standin' side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
[Chorus]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
