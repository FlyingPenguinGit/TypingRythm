[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
When I walk on by, girls be lookin' like, "Damn, he fly"
I pimp to the beat, walking down the street in my new LaFreak
Yeah, this is how I roll, animal print, pants outta control
It's Redfoo with the big afro
and like Bruce Leroy, I got the glow, yeah
[Refrain]
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) I-I-I-I work out
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) I-I-I-I work out
[Pre-Chorus]
When I walk in the spot (Yeah), this is what I see (Okay)
Everybody stops and is staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
Show it, show it, show it
[Chorus]
I'm sexy and I know it
I'm sexy and I know it[Verse 2]
Yo, when I'm at the mall, security just can't fight 'em all
And when I'm at the beach, I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks
(What?)
This is how I roll, come on, ladies, it's time to go
We headed to the bar, baby, don't be nervous
No shoes, no shirt, and I still get service, watch
[Refrain]
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) I-I-I-I work out
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
I-I-I-I work out
[Pre-Chorus]
When I walk in the spot (Yeah)
This is what I see (Okay)
Everybody stops and is staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
Show it, show it, show it
[Chorus]
I'm sexy and I know it, ayy
I'm sexy and I know it
Check it out, check it out[Bridge]
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wig—, yeah, yeah
Do the wiggle, man
I do the wiggle, man
Yeah, I'm sexy and I know it
Ayy, yeah
[Refrain]
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) I-I-I-I work out
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) I-I-I-I work out
[Outro]
I'm sexy and I know it
