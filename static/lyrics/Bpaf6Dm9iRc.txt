[Intro]
Mm
Yeah, uh
[Verse 1]
See you so excited (Mm)
You got him locked down (Mmh, yeah)
You're movin' like I did (Mm)
Before I found out
He ain't just a pretty-faced talker
Good with his money, close to his mother
You're seein' one-sided (Sided)
You got him right now
[Pre-Chorus]
And she be like, "He's so perfect"
I be like, "Oh, what version?"
"Ain't nobody got me this nervous"
Oh, baby, I been there (Hey)
And right in that same position (Hey)
So, baby, don't get this twisted (Hey)
No, nothin' could make me miss it
Take him, he's yours
[Chorus]
It's okay, I'm okay, had him in the first place
It's okay, I'm okay (I'm okay, yeah, yeah)
It's okay, I'm okay, I don't really gotta say
It's okay (Okay)[Post-Chorus]
You can have him anyway (Way)
Anyway (Way)
You can have him anyway (Way)
Anyway (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 2]
Was such a romantic (Romantic)
You got me like, "Fuck that"
Some months and some long flights
Now I can't go near that
[Pre-Chorus]
And she be like, "He's so perfect"
I be like, "Oh, what version?"
"Ain't nobody got me this nervous" (Nervous)
Oh, baby, I've been there (Hey)
And right in that same position (Hey)
So, baby, don't get this twisted (Hey)
No, nothin' could make me miss it
Take him, he's yours
[Chorus]
It's okay, I'm okay, had him in the first place
It's okay, I'm okay (I'm okay)
It's okay, I'm okay, I don't really gotta say
It's okay (Okay)[Post-Chorus]
You can have him anyway (Way)
Anyway (Way)
You can have him anyway (Way)
Anyway (Way, way, way)
[Chorus]
It's okay, I'm okay, had him in the first place
It's okay, I'm okay (I'm okay, I'm okay)
It's okay, I'm okay, I don't really gotta say (It's okay)
It's okay
[Post-Chorus]
You can have him anyway (Anyway)
Anyway (Anyway)
You can have him anyway (Anyway)
Anyway (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Outro]
I don't want him anyway, girl, take him
I don't want him anyway, girl, take him
I don't want him anyway, girl, take him (It's okay, take him)
I don't want him (Yeah, I don't), I don't want him (Yeah, I don't)
I don't want him (Anyway) anyway, girl, take him (Want him anyway)
I don't want him (Anyway) anyway, girl, take him (Anyway)
I don't, it's okay, it's okay, take him (Anyway)
I don't want him (Yeah, I don't), I don't want him
