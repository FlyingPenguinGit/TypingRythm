[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry
[Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by[Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child of mine
Woah woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
[Instrumental Break]
Ooh
Oh
Oh, oh-oh, yeah
[Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet child of mine
Oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Sweet love of mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet child of mine, ooh, yeah
Ooh
Sweet love of mine
