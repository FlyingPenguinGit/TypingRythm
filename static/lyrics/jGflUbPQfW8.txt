[Verse 1]
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen 'cause she stays strong, yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
[Pre-Chorus]
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
"Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheatin'?"
I'm like, "No, not really," 'cause
[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
[Verse 2]
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle, yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand[Pre-Chorus]
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
"Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheatin'?"
I'm like, "No, not really," 'cause
[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
[Trumpet Solo]
[Bridge]
She gives me love and affection, baby, did I mention?
You're the only girl for me, no, I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do is just for me to pop the question
[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
