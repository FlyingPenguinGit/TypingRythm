[Verse:Edisto]
My life is a dojo
,
Dnick is my mentor
After okroku saiki cuz he deaded master splinter
Ties with the beat, I'm talking double Windsor
I don't think these rappers have a clue what they're in for
,
Hailing from the undefeated School of the east
Mailing back severed body parts opponents of deceased
,
Log $uprme, on his Morgan Free
,
he let me off the leash unrestricted when I kick it,jet li ima beast
Like the one baki the grappler yasha crag was,spectacular
,
Tossing frags of vernacular
/
deep in the city of lavender
,
accents the clothes that my master wore
Understand that this man a B.O.A.R
,
head high, back low, that lion roar
Life by the horns no matador
riding beats what's that saddle
,
Setting fire like Saboteur
(damn you spazin boi pls elaborate saboteur?)
Um, EA
or Hitchcock
,
tell ke$ha tiktok wristwatch
Young embodiment of hip hop
,
holding heavy metal like slipknot
but ain't talking clip pop
Stop a horse on its 5th trot
,(stop a horse in its 5 trot?dammit when will this shit stop?)
Tote big kantanas, Zanbatō
,
Newtype
Ray so Armuro
Dou Chi! for my armor tho
, place,me on the honor roll
Mentions are not honorable,
save that talk for Donahue
Too vibrant turn it down a hue
,
Im spitting like a llama fool
