[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Mm, ayy-oh
Hey, Ratatat, yeah
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 a.m., summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Drivin' drunk, I'm doin' my thing
Rollin' the Midwest side and out
Livin' my life, gettin' our dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screamin' out "Fuck that"
I'ma do just what I want, lookin' ahead, no turnin' back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets
[Chorus:Andrew VanWyngarden& Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Tell me, what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me, what you know about the night terrors every night?
5 a.m., cold sweats, wakin' up to the sky
Tell me, what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me, what you know about night terrors? Nothin'
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow
[Chorus: Andrew VanWyngarden & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness
I know everything that shine ain't always gold
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good[Guitar Solo: Mike Stroud]
[Chorus:Andrew VanWyngarden& Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Pursuit of happiness, yeah
I don't get it, I'll be good
Oh, oh, man, oh, ugh
Room's spinnin', room's spinnin'
Pat, Zuli, oh, fuck
Oh my God, why'd I drink so much and smoke so much? Oh
Oh, fuck
