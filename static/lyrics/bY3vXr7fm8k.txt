[Verse 1]
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for faith-departed
[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
But I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
[Verse 2]
Yeah, this is for ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
[Pre-Chorus]
Tomorrow's gettin' harder, make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, gotta make your own breaks
[Chorus]
It's my life, and  it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life[Talkbox Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Better stand tall when they're callin' you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
[Chorus]
It's my life and it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life
