[Pre-Chorus: PinkPantheress]
Your hair's under my pillow, so I sleep (So I sleep)
And I'm dreaming of you leaving roses at my feet (Nastylgia, at my feet)
I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believe
When you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)
[Chorus: Central Cee &PinkPantheress]
I hope a trap boy's your type (Why?)
'Cause I don't have a nine-to-five (Alright)
I get that your standards high
But I'm not a random guy, I'm different (Literally,at my feet)
When I write my rhymes, you say you don't like that line
I'll switch it (Calm)
You said you don't like my life, you said you don't like my guys, you're trippin

(When you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me?)
[Bridge: PinkPantheress &Central Cee]
I followed you, I followed you today, I was in my car (Alright)
I wanted to come see you from afar (At my feet)
If you turned around and saw me I would die
When you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me?
[Verse: Central Cee &PinkPantheress]
Bad one and she photogenic (Alright)
Instagram got a lot of impressions (Uh-huh,hear it now)
She think I'm a G and I don't need love
But I need some thug affection (Literally,me, me, love me)
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
Man, I got twenty-one questions (Like fifty,just me)
In the trap with the cats, domestics
She doin' lashes, somethin' cosmetic
They shot their shot, she read it
They slid in the DM with somethin' generic (Huh,hear it now)
She don't even like goin' out
Got a new outfit, but nowhere to wear it (Alright)
She think that I'm bein' disloyal when I'm in the streets with couple of killys (You ain't gotta)
You ain't gotta worry 'bout none of these hoes
I'm grown, I'm done with these bitches (Done with these bitches, done with these bitches)[Pre-Chorus: PinkPantheress]
Your hair's under my pillow, so I sleep (So I sleep)
And I'm dreaming of you leaving roses at my feet (At my feet)
I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believe
When you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)
[Chorus: Central Cee]
I hope a trap boy's your type (Why?)
'Cause I don't have a nine-to-five (Alright)
I get that your standards high
But I'm not a random guy, I'm different (Literally,at my feet)
When I write my rhymes, you say you don't like that line
I'll switch it (Calm)
You said you don't like my life, you said you don't like my guys, you're trippin'
[Outro: Central Cee &PinkPantheress]
Wipe them just for me? Me, me, me, me
I hope a trap boy's your type
'Cause I don't have a nine-to-five
Do you wipe them just for me? Me, me, me, me
I get that your standards high
But I'm not a random guy, I'm different
I'm pleading on my knees (Knees, knees, knees, knees)
When I write my rhymes, you say you don't like that line
I'll switch it
You said you don't like my life
It's your touch that I need (Need, need, need, need)
When you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for—
