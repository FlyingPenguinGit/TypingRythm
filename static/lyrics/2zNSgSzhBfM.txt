[Conor Maynard] (Justin Timberlake- Cry Me A River)
You were my sun, you were my Earth
You didn't know all the way I loved you, no
[Olly Murs] (Passenger- Let Her Go)
You only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go
[Conor Maynard] (he Chainsmoker- Don't Let Me Go)
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
[Olly Murs] (Taylor Swift- I Knew You Were Trouble)
Yeah I knew you were trouble when you walked in
[Conor Maynard] (Bruno Mars- Locked Out Of Heaven)
Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
[Olly Murs] (R Kelly- Ignition (Remix))

Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rolling that body got every man in her wishing[Conor Maynard] (DJ Snake- Middle (ft. Bipolar Sunshine)
With us two in the middle
[Olly Murs] (John Legend- All Of Me)
All of me
Loved all of you
All your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
[Conor Maynard] (Zedd- Clarity (ft. Foxes))
If our love is tragedy why are you my remedy
If our love's insanity why are you my clarity
[Olly Murs] (Jack Ü- Where Are Ü Now (ft. Justin Bieber))
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith and you doubted it open
Can't deny it

You're toxic I'm slipping under
[Olly Murs] (Amy Winehouse- Rehab)
They try to make me go to rehab I say, no, no, no[Conor Maynard] (Usher- Confessions, Pt. II)
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm thrown and I don't know what to do
Guess I gotta give part two
[Olly Murs] (Macklemore & Ryan Lewis - Can't Hold Us (ft. Ray Dalton))
Here we go back
This is the moment
Tonight is the night
We'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up, like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
[Conor Maynard] (Jack Ü- Where Are Ü Now (ft. Justin Bieber))
Where are you now that I need you
[Olly Murs] (Gotye- Somebody That I Used To Know (ft. Kimbra))
You didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
[Conor Maynard] (Nickelback- Rockstar)
Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
Live in hilltop houses driving 15 cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat and we'll[Olly Murs] (Nickelback- Rockstar)
Hey, I wanna be a rockstar, hey
[Conor Maynard] (The Weeknd- Wicked Games)
I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
[Olly Murs] (Ed Sheeran- A Team)
And they say, she's in the class A-team
[Conor Maynard] (Hozier- Take Me To Church)
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
[Olly Murs] (Jay Z- Holy Grail (ft. Justin Timberlake))
You took the clothes of my back
And I let you
[Both] (David Guetta- 2U (ft Justin Bieber))
When it comes to you
Don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Comes to you
