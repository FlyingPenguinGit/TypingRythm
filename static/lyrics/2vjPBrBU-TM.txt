[Verse 1]
Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anythin', when will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down
I'm the one for a good time call
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, I feel the love
[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
[Chorus]
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly
Like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
[Post-Chorus]
But I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Help me, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight, on for tonight[Verse 2]
Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame
(Ah)
[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
[Chorus]
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly
Like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
[Post-Chorus]
But I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Help me, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight, on for tonight[Outro]
On for tonight
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holdin' on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holdin' on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
