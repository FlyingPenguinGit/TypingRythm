[Verse: Reece Bullimore]
Sorry, I ain't got no money
I'm not trying to be funny
But I left it all at home today
You can call me what you wanna
I ain't giving you a dollar
This time I ain't gonna run away
You might knock me down
You might knock me down
But I will get back up again
You can call it how you wanna
I ain't giving you a dollar
This time I ain't gonna run away (Run away, run away)
[Build: Reece Bullimore]
This time, this time, this time
This time I ain't gonna run, run, run, run
[Drop: Reece Bullimore]
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
(Not this time)
(Run, run, run)
