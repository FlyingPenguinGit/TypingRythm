[Chorus: JC & Justin,Justin]
It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it, too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you (Hey yeah)
[Verse 1: JCwith Chris]
Baby, I don't understand
Just why we can't be lovers
Things are getting out of hand
Tryin' too much, but
baby, we can win
[Pre-Chorus: JCwith Chris]
Let it go
If you want me,
girl, let me know
I am
down on my knees
I can't take it anymore
[Chorus: All]
It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it, too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you
[Interlude: JC]
Oh, alright[Verse 2: Justinwith Chris,JC,All]
Baby, don't misunderstand (Don't misunderstand)
What I'm tryin' to tell ya
In the corner of my mind (Corner of my mind)
Baby, it feels like we're runnin'
out of time
[Pre-Chorus: Justinwith Chris]
Let it go
If you want me,
girl, let me know
I am
down on my knees
I can't take it anymore, oh, oh, baby
[Chorus: All]
It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it, too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you
[Bridge: All,JC,Justin]
Tearin' up my heart and soul
We're apart, I feel it, too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you
Tearin' up my heart and soul (Alright)
We're apart, I feel it too (I feel it, too)
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you[Chorus: Justin & Lance,JC, Chris & Joey,All]
It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
(Tearin' up my heart and soul)
But when we are apart, I feel it, too
(We're apart, I feel it, too)
And no
matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you
[Outro: All]
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you
