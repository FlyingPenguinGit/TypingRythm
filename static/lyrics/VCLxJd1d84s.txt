[Riff: Nicole Scherzinger]
Eee-eee, eee!
Eee-eee, eee!
[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh)
But you keep frontin', uh
Sayin' what you gon' do to me (Uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh)
But you keep frontin', uh
Sayin' what you gon' do to me (Uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing
[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger]
Typical ain't hardly the type I fall for
I like when the physical don't leave me askin' for more
I'm a sexy mama (Mama)
Who knows just how to get what I wanna (Wanna)
What I wanna do is spring this on ya (On ya)
Back up all the things that I told ya (Told ya, told ya, told ya)
You been sayin' all the right things all night long
But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off
[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
Baby, can't you see (See)
How these clothes are fitting on me (Me)
And the heat coming from this beat? (Beat)
I'm about to blow, I don't think you know[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh)
But you keep frontin', uh
Sayin' what you gon' do to me (Uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh)
But you keep frontin', uh
Sayin' what you gon' do to me (Uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing
[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger]
You say you're a big boy, but I can't agree
'Cause the love you said you had ain't been put on me
I wonder (Wonder) if I'm just too much for you
Wonder (Wonder) if my kiss don't make you just wonder (Wonder)
What I got next for you, what you wanna do? (Do)
Take the chance to recognize that this could be yours
I can see, just like most guys, that your game don't please
[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
Baby, can't you see (See)
How these clothes are fitting on me (Me)
And the heat coming from this beat? (Beat)
I'm about to blow, I don't think you know
[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger,Melody Thornton]

But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh)

Sayin' what you gon' do to me (Uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing[Riff: Nicole Scherzinger]
