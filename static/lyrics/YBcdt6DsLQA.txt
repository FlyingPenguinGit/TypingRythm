[Verse 1: John Lennon,John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
There are
places I remember
All my life, though some have changed (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Some
forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Bridge: John Lennon,John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
All these
places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are
dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all
[Verse 2: John Lennon,John Lennon & PaulMcCartney]
But of
all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And these
memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Bridge: John Lennon,John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Though I
know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
[Piano Solo][Bridge: John Lennon,John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Though I
know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
[Outro: John Lennon]
In my life, I love you more
