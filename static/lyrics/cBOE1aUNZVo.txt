[Verse 1]
I wanna smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies
[Pre-Chorus]
We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you
[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, oh, oh, over you
[Verse 2]
Stuck in a real bad dream
And, man, it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms, but I'm beggin' at your feet
It's been a real hard night
And I just hold my pillow tight
It won't love me back, no, it's not you and I[Pre-Chorus]
We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying (No more crying)
To get me through (To get me through)
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you
[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, oh, oh, over you (Oh)
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you (Tonight)
Tonight, I'm getting over you (Oh)
Over you, oh, oh, over you
[Outro]
We're not lovers (Tonight, I'm getting)
But more than friends (Tonight, I'm getting)
Put a flame to every single word you ever said (Tonight, I'm getting)
(Tonight, I'm getting over you)
No more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you
