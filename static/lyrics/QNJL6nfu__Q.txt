[Verse 1: MCNorad]
Lettin off, I never change
People always wanna hate my name
They ain’t never really got to know me
‘Till they couldn’t beat me at this damn game
And they buddy-buddy, like they got a lot of money
God, I don't really care about nobody
I been rollin over ‘till I throw ‘em over
Imma hold ‘em ‘till I got alot of bodies
They don’t even know about the pain that I been through, huh
They don’t even know about the difference of my lyricism, Lil Tecca, huh
Everybody always thinkin they good, causе they can make a little trap, likе huh
I wish I could take it to make it a wave, for you to go and pass away like, uh
Gotta be the one to get it whenever the venom hit ‘em
Imma get ‘em whenever I ride on, they ‘gon die from
The semi-automatic whenever I pull it back
Imma let it go blap and snap like a bygone
Stickin to the guns, make it talk smack now
I ain’t ever back down, I been waitin like its pack now
Imma get ‘em slumped over when I trunk over
Like I’m waiting pull the damn mack out
[Verse 2: Ease]
Yeah, yeah
Days, years, you wanna be over your fears?
I break the bank, you shift the gears
I’ll take a stand and lift your ears
If only, damn, I miss the years
To follow my own ideas
I been in the prison, and seen what a vision
Is similar to livin until it appears
Buy them a bit of time, I.D
I, why, that’s feelin alive
So why cover your eyes?
How are the blind gonna lead the blind?
If there’s no reason about evolvin it
Then there ain’t no openin
If nobody's soul is holdin it
How’s anybody gonna get ahold of it?
Well, when I start focusin
I can’t explain the control I’m in
Try underestimate over it
Well I never been a fan of mediocre, no!
And not once or twice
Make halfway, thats a halfway price
Love don’t matter, innit?
You wanna figure out chances, roll the dice
I’m what I did, what I do, that's cardinal
What I plan for better be remarkable
With a success rate so marginal
I gotta shoot high not just passable
I mean, I remain to stay blessed
The more twisted this game gets
Step on the level to make bets
No other way is in my interest, lord[Verse 3: Colorboi]
In the dough with the mojo
Feelin like I could pull about four hoes
I don’t lie to ‘em, let ‘em know my M.O
Ain’t tryna be a man, just wanna be a rental
Granddaddy was a pimp, daddy just a gimp
So I walk with a bounce not a limp
And tell these hoes what it is
Never cross the main bitch
I do this properly, fuck with the same hoe
She our hoe, she fuckin the same clique
You can’t have her back ‘till we say we finished
All I spit is halitosis, I need to see the dentist
Leave these niggas in a state of rigamortis
I’m a product of a failed abortion
Feelin like they failed preventin me from the torture
So bitch you can't get a Porshe
Unless you lookin like a Porche
Make a nigga forfeit
While I’m feelin like the force of some war shit
I left a poor bitch dreamin real rich
Cause we on the same shit so we get it how we live
Gotta collect the payment, baby what you make me
Sellin that pussy ‘till its outdated
You know a little arrangement, sellin that anus
Ain’t I a fool?  Goddamn right[Verse 4: KaijuKidd]
Now I’m in the zone, rappin bone
‘Bout to steal ‘em like a phone
Gunshots to the dome
Knock, knock, anybody home?
Bitches droppin tags like calls to my phone
Slingin these tracks like the dolphin
Plenty girls like a nigga in the major league
So high I can only spit that make believe
Disrespect will end in tragedy, tragedy
Usually these hoes be usin me
Due to the music you see lyric charts on the beat cause of yuh!
Your girl be viewin me, steady persuin me, next time she screwin the D
Niggas be mad cause I stay doin me
Livin the life of a thug like a G
Rollin the papers and smokin the sweets
And best believe, I carry that heat, cause
Michael Jordan, might record ‘em
Put ‘em hoes up on the board, why you keep on scorin?
I’m on all these other rappers are the movin target
Steady takin aim cause your music garbage
Step up to the mic you better bring your hardest
Steady eatin rappers cause your boys starvin
Cookin up lyrics like I’m G. Garvin
Havin ladies laughin like my name is Martin
Never cariogenic cause a nigga got it
Make a nigga jaw like it’s scran and gone
Niggas talk shit so I beg your pardon
She give good brain make a nigga retarded
If we got a problem nigga we can solve it
Lyrics that I spit will leave you demolished
Armageddon’s comin and it’s not tomorrow
Your girl is a freak cause she always swallow
Hit it from the back make the pussy hollow
You a little nigga imma call you Rallow
‘Bout to teach a sermon imma call it revival
Better pay attention this is me and survival
Better yet bruh it’s time to retire
Take the weak shit back like you from eight mile
Career niggas know how to spit that fire
Watchin all these rap-rappers tryna burn it
I’m takin they earnings, so steady they learnin
Determined to spit this verse just like a sermon
What is a saint if he’s heavily burdened?
While changin the game and definin his purpose
Surrounded by serpents who spittin they wordless
Worship that they call them verses[Verse 5: iSh]
Uh, they say they wavy then I surfboard on ‘em
They ‘gon make me put the work all on ‘em
I’m tryna get the money with the people I came up with
And them haters I make ‘em sick
They get mad cause their girl wanna take the pic
They should be glad that I don’t let her take the…
I got it on lock, come on
I don’t care about your song or what blog you on
You had a little run but you wasn’t hot for long
I’m always with it never off and on
Never drop the ball, get the cheese like pasta sauce
Girl I love the way you drop to the song if you with it
I do anything for the payroll, banknotes, or pesos, its all bueno
Get her so wet I think I need a raincoat
The way you work it I don’t know how to thank you, damn
I’m out here flexin like I’m Hulk Hogan
Always comin with the real, no, never spit that siliconin
I be sippin on that potion
Sippin on that potion, act so reckless with the money
You would think we fuckin stole it
So don’t come back unless you gettin it in
Cause girl I ain’t here to play, like I’m sittin on the bench
Aw man, turn this up if you fuckin with it
[Verse 6: Servillious]
I can hear them, yes they slewin
Can you feel it, storm is brewin
They don’t know ‘bout what they doin
Can't break me I see them screwin
Can't take me so keep it movin
They don’t know I keep it gluten
Angers grew, I keep it glued in
Time has come and no more booin
Takin the D to the B to arena
Makin this seem like a dream for the G fold
Breakin the team for the C, naw, C note
Hatin the fiend cause I’m mean in the mean mode
Bakin the B for the beef for the reload
Keepin the ground, dead man up on the Ceelo
Breakin the chain for the dream for the B mode
Yes I’m back, call it beastmode
Run after you, I said run after you
Gunshot ting when I run after you
Run after you, I said run after you
Take his life at the end of the route
Man be talkin that crud
Slug his face with the blood in the mud
Hawkin and walkin go drown in a flood
Milita vibes straight stealth no hunt
Yeah, we say laughs when his ducks out, lucks out
Fadin the skies with his guts out
No place is safe when I lace this space
When I ace it out of your mums house
Don’t give no fucks when I’m schemin, dreamin
Runnin the ting, get beamin
You best believe your soul is leavin
You got no family you left to be grievin
[Verse 7: Sean Pharo]
Holy, hold up what the hannen?
Pickin motives like its Madden
On the lowkey I been snappin
Niggas phony with the cappin, yeah
I cannot switch up the faction
With the homies in the action
Money been stackin, I got my grands and my Franklins and Jacksons
Slide with my bro-bro, no this ain’t Marvel
Ride with my roady I look like I’m Tony
These niggas snake and they shoot like the Kobe
Fuck all that talkin you better come show me
She heard I’m fire now she tryna blow me
I hit it once now she act like she know me
And look ain’t no suck for the bitch from the homie
You let it slide and they slide on your homie
Ooh, yuh, ran up the check, yeah, I did it, I got it
Ran to the bank had to make a deposit
I’m with the gang I’m with loco I promise
Stay with my dog like its Wallace and Gromit
All of these rings on me lookin like Sonic
You like to hate on your bro in the comments
Cause got the white like he cleanin with comet
Man, fuck this shit, homocide, yeah
[Verse 8: Lil Gotti]
Take a step back, who that, where we at
Who it be, oh you wantin lack
Seen your body on the block, that shit was wack
Spread out, true, yeah, here’s where its at
We the hot shit, we the lost link
Large like Titanic but we don’t sink
Turn his body on his head before you can blink
Before you can even think about escapin it
Yo, you ain’t even gettin close to this
Don’t even try, cause I got you on the top of my list
Systems cranked out all the doors
We got a half-body bangin out on every floor
Dangerous, part man, part us
Feelin brave, get your gear on, come party with us
Put this crew in a room and guarantee that we rock it
Off the hours, not like four locked in
Raise that sound, push the fade us
Club like ram with the kids that made us
Yeah that's right, slam the disco
From Brooklyn, NY to San Francisco
Smash the disco, yo, pass the phone
Party up in our spot ‘til the speakers blow
Yo, make it apparent that we runnin the show
Where does it end man, who cares, nobody knows
Spaz out, we gonna ride out
No crowd control here, fuck that
Got trouble on the go, nine lives the cat
Well, you asked for the best, no doubt in fact
It’s no mystery how we do the things we love to do without the strings
We got more styles than a hair salon
When we crash that stage then you know its on
[Verse 9: Micah Byrnes]
I never rapped right, but I never rapped wrong
Tellin you my story by the end of the song
I been playin with the game cause it’s all true
I been playin with this game tryin not to fuck with you
I got all of my brothers always backin me up
Man, all the same bitches tryna fuck my shit up
All these hoes thinkin, they can turn this shit off
But I know that they can’t so I never let up
But these hoes tryna tell me that they know shit
And I know for a fact that they don’t know shit
Cause I taught them the game, man, I own them
Cause I made the rules up and I enforce them
But these hoes never give up, no they don’t
I been waitin for my spirit, to fuckin go
Imma wreck all these bitches everyday
Imma ball a man out the fuckin way
But I did anyway, cause this motherfucker slay
Not for the pay, just to say, that I pound every fuckin day
Even if I’m gay, man, I fuckin play it
I fuckin slay, yo, I already said that though
Cause you a fag, and I don’t brag
But I do, its not me its you, like I said, you a fag
So I cover face with a plastic bag, its alright man
Yo, fuck the slack, imma stay here
Imma wreck everynight, imma play this game
Imma motherfuckin fight, imma motherfuckin fight
Everyday and everynight, imma fuckin wreck
Imma take a step up, imma fuckin play
Imma fuckin play man
[Verse 10: Khaos Official]
Never change on ‘em, even if they change
Cause they know I can hit them from long range
With the sniper scope, while you sellin dope
I hit the shot, and I turn the page
Start off slow to ease it in
This verse ain’t gonna be the end
Cause I’ll switch it up next bar, when I hit you with the bend
If you think imma be givin up soon then
You don’t know I be transforming, cocoon
And I’ll finish it today by the time its noon
And you won’t ever make it out, even soon, cause
Makin all this dough just a pastime to fill up my time
And I’m spittin fire through my mouth whenever I go rhyme
I got thirty thousand hundreds in my pockets, got a dime
Waited sixteen years, but now I know it is my time to shine
So bright like a star, you don’t even know you are
You be sittin at the bar, while I’m movin up the bar
Can’t say I’m on par, cause I’m the greatest by far
Like a star, lift the bar, drivin car, give you scar
Like simba, you lion, and I see your career dyin
And I do feel bad, cause I can still tell you tryin
Liquor, have some rigor, girl be thicker
And you shrinking everyday while my career gettin bigger
So next time don’t try to play with me
Beause this hill be gettin steeper
Don’t get on our bad side, cause
We fifty deep, and we goin deeper
[Verse 11: Shadow]
I’m the bomb and I get my racks
My songs blow up more than Iraq
My girls Al Qaeda, I blow out her back
Feast on dead bodies like a Gunna snack
Grim reaper, collect ethers
Neck got more water than a baptist preacher
Ice on my wrist is like a freezer
Got a bag rolled up with dope and reefer
Seen more girls nude than a bathroom peeper
And I fill up more space than a overweight beaver
That egghead was cancerous so go get the beater
People see me like a god as if I am Demeter
They be featherweights in the ring so get the birdfeeder
I steal your girl faster than Derek Jeter
They comin for my millions but I’m faster than a cheetah
I’m mixin all my hennesy up with margaritas
My friends two faced like cerebral palsy
With a transplant coochie, these dykes so balsy
You won’t wanna live without me like Halsey
She ride more wood than Harry Potty
Hit the jackpot like Scottie Wotty
And I fill her up faster than Pippen, Scottie
Could never face me like a robot army
My size overwhelms her like a Skarmy
Were the rap Rushmore of mountain range
I stay woke, but I wake up to fame
My money bends reality like Doctor Strange
She takes more balls than a driving range
I regret what I said about climate change
We’ll work together and make a change
